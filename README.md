# Dotfiles for the public

These are my public dotfiles.  There should not be any configurations specific to me in this repo.

Use [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) to manage these files in your home directory.

I recommend that you create a repository with all of our specific configurations in it.

Alternatively, some of the configurations will support a local specific configuration.
